# Simulations API Documentation - Ortho (public)

## Overview
This document describes how Simulations API's public Ortho feature works.

To execute a ortho simulation the client will need to do a single request `POST /public-api/simulations/ortho` sending the photo binary as `multipart/form-data`. The response will be in JSON format as detailed along this document.

This request is meant to be done directly by the client (via web browser or mobile devices), using a server as middleman won't work since we have ip rate limiting to prevent malicious usage.

### Request Structure
- POST /public-api/simulations/ortho
- Headers
  - `Authorization: Bearer $Token`
  - `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
  - `Origin: https://client-host.com` (for CORS)
- Body _(format: multipart/form-data)_
  - `imgPhoto: $PHOTO_BLOB`
	- `data: $DATA_JSON` (Optional)


#### Illustrating with cURL
```
curl -XPOST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $Token" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "Origin: https://client-host.com" \ # if CORS validation is enabled
	-F "imgPhoto=@$PHOTO_PATH" \
	-F 'data={"captureType": "camera", "externalCustomerId": "customer-id"}' \
	"https://api.e91efc7.dentrino.ai/public-api/simulations/ortho"
```

## Demo

### Install Dependencies
To run serve the demo webapp first install the dependencies by running:
```
# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Credentials
By default it'll use the following credentials (for testing purposes only):
```
CLIENT_ID=ODMzNDQwMDMzNzU4OFdLIztKNFJd_testext_front
CLIENT_SECRET=2dba220dc7b1ffbbf96104bd4cdce7fabf2ec00af8083ccbb8fa51ba12c2924e
```

### Sending requests via webapp
This folder can be served as a small webapp that send requests to the api. To do that run:
```
httpserver

# Starting server on ('127.0.0.1', 8080)
```

After starting the server access `http://localhost:8080` to send photos to the api. You can also read the files `index.html` and `js/*` to understand better how to make those requests.


## Token
### Overview
The token informs which client is using the API and prevents data from being tampered. It needs to be generated before each request and sent in the `Authorization` header.


To generate a token the client will need a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` that will be generated by TastyTech to each client. The `Client Secret` is used to hash the claims preventing them from being tampered.

The token is composed by two parts joined by an `:`.
```
// Illustrative pseudo-code
CLAIMS_JSON = "{...}"
ENCODED_CLAIMS = base64($CLAIMS_JSON)
CLAIMS_SIGNATURE = hmac.sha256($CLAIMS_JSON, $CLIENT_SECRET)
TOKEN="$ENCODED_CLAIMS:$CLAIMS_SIGNATURE"
```

### Token Claims
The claims are represented as a JSON and have the following information:
```
{
  "clientId": "...",
  "recaptchaToken": "...", # if recaptcha validation is enabled
  "paramsHashed": { ... }
}

// Recaptcha Token isn't mandatory for mobile clients.
```

#### Claim: `clientId`
The plain `CLIENT_ID`.


#### Claim: `recaptchaToken`
The token responded by Recaptcha v3. We recommend it be used on web browsers, see [Recaptcha v3 Google Docs](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3) for more information.


#### Claim: `paramsHashed`
All the parameters sent in the body as `multipart/form-data` must be hashed as MD5 and added to the `claims.paramsHashed` JSON.

```
// Sample of "paramsHashed when sending "imgPhoto: $PHOTO_BINARY", and "data: $DATA_JSON" in the body
{
  ...
  "paramsHashed": {
    "imgPhoto": md5($PHOTO_BINARY),
		"data": md5($DATA_JSON)
  }
}
```


### Response Structure
#### Success

```
// Status Code: 2xx
{
  "success": true,
  "beforeUrl": "https://.../before.jpg?...",
  "resultUrl": "https://.../result.jpg?..."
}
```

#### Error

```
// Status Code: 4xx / 5xx
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "id": "PUBLIC ID",
		"subtype": "ERROR SUB TYPE", // optional
    "message": "PUBLIC MESSAGE",
    "debug": {
      "__ALERT__": "THIS DEBUG OBJECT WILL NOT EXIST IN PRODUCTION",
      "debugId": "INTERNAL ID FOR DEBUGGING",
      "message": "MESSAGE FOR DEBBUGGING"
    }
  }
}
```
